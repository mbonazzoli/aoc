Advent of Code project

This project is my progress on the Advent of Code exercise: https://adventofcode.com/2018/about

This project uses Java with the Spring boot framework to create a RESTful response to each problem every day.

An easy way to view the answers is by using postman to call responses to the endpoints created.
The answer will then appear as the response.

###Future Direction
Create a front end to work with the RESTful endpoints for a seemless answer gathering
